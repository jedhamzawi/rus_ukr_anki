# rus Files

Included here are some of the Russian words that I first learned when learning
Russian. I gleaned them from a book of the most common Russian words, and after
speaking Russian for five years, I can confirm that many of them are quite useful
(though perhaps not *all* are).

I've left them in the repo in case they prove useful for someone. :)
