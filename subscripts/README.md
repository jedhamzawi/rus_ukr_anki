# Sub-scripts

Technically, each component of the main script can be run individually
(translation, stress, csv-joining, and Anki importing). You can look at the
scripts in this `subscripts` folder to see their arguments and how you can
use them.

This is useful if any portion of the main script fails. You can run the
subscripts beginning at the part where things broke and go from there.
